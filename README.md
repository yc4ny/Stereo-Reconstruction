## Environment Setup
> Note: This code was developed on Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 with Python 3.7. Later versions should work, but have not been tested.
Create and activate a virtual environment to work in, e.g. using Conda:

```
conda create -n venv_stereo python=3.7
conda activate venv_stereo
```
Install the remaining requirements with pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You must also have _ffmpeg_ installed on your system to save visualizations.
