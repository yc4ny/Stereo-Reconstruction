# Stereo Reconstruction - Reconstructing 3D Human Keypoints from 2D Images
This is my implementation of Stereo Camera Reconstruction using DLT (Direct Linear Transform), Triangulation with Linear/Non-Linear Optimization through Python.

> - Red points indicate the 2D reprojection of the reconstructed 3D points. <br/>
> - Green points indicate the 2D points found by MATLAB's Camera Calibrator.<br/> 
> - The "ON" sign in green indicates that the checkerboard points have been detected with MATLAB's calibrator. There must be at least 2 cameras with "ON" sign in order to reconstruct 3D points.<br/>

## Environment Setup
> Note: This code was developed on Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 with Python 3.7. Later versions should work, but have not been tested.
Create and activate a virtual environment to work in, e.g. using Conda:

```
conda create -n venv_stereo python=3.7
conda activate venv_stereo
```
Install the remaining requirements with pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You must also have _ffmpeg_ installed on your system to save visualizations.
